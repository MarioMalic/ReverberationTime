# ReverberationTime

## Why?
To calculate the room reverberation time and apparent sound reduction index for the 1/3 octave bands from the LabVIEW data

## Features
  - Automatic calculation of reverberation time
  - Automatic calculation of apparent sound reduction index

## How to install the application?
Requirements:
  * MATLAB R2023a (compatibility with other versions is to be checked)
  * lvm_import function ([file that imports LabVIEW .lvm files which can be obtained from MATLAB File Exchange](https://uk.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/19913-lvm-file-import))

The code is distributed as the .mlapp file which you can open within MATLAB.

## How to use the application?
Load the data using Browse button and click on the Process file(s) button. Example of data should is in the Analysis folder and it should only contain the microphone data after trigger. In LabVIEW, you should use specific settings in the function "Write measurement file" to match the provided ones.

## How to support this project?
This project is considered obsolete as there is no current need to develop it further.
